# Background

This project is the third assignment of COMP551 : Applied Machine Learning taught by Professor Isabeau Pr√©mont-Schwarz in Fall 2023 at McGill University.

Emotion detection enables machines to detect various emotions. The technique that helps machines and computers to be capable of detecting, expressing and understanding emotions is known as emotional intelligence. In this miniproject you will implement naive Bayes from scratch and BERT-based model with pertained weights through package and finetuning, and compare these algorithms on Emotion dataset. The goal is to gain experience implementing machine learning algorithm from scratch and running the modern deep learning libraries, and getting hands-on experience comparing their performances on the real-world textual dataset.
